# Basic cybersecurity information

Passwords
The most common password in 2020:
1. 123456
2. 123456789
3. picture1
4. password
5. 12345678
6. 111111
7. 123123
8. 12345
9. 1234567890
10. senha

If you password is above, change it today.

Most phones have a minimum requirement of 4 digit passcode. How much time will it take to crack 4 digit passcode? You can use brute force attack.
10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10,000 

Only takes less than 1 second to code in python.

What's better than a 4 digit passcode. More digits, so it takes more time to crack your code.

Is 4-letter passcode better? (lower and upper)
52 x 52 x 52 x 52 = 7,311,616

What's better? Add a special character. 
Should be at least 8 characters long, letters, numbers and punctation.
Will take years to compute. 

But the more complex and random, the more likely someone will write it on a sticky on their monitor. 

Disable access after you don't correctly login to your phone.  But bad if your phone will self-destruct after too many errors.

*Two-factor authentication*
Do you use on one site? Do you use it on all sites? Anything that is sensitive or important, you want to raise the bar to 2FA. 

A second factor, means a different factor available to access your phone that someone can't get. 

Does 2FA secure your account? Does it keep adversaries out completely? It does stop the people who are physically close to you and can steal your phone, but 

*Password manager*
Better solution that memorizing or writing the password on a post-it. The ones that come with your phone is free... not using is a missed opportunity if you don't want to pay. The software remembers a crazy long password. 
* credential manager
* keychain
* 1Password
* LastPass
Even if the website is hacked and that specific password is leaked. You aren't using it anywhere else. It won't be cracked by brute force because it's a long password. 
What's the down side? If you use someone else's computer, you have to manually type it in. You are putting all your eggs in 1 basket... they have access to every account... unless you have 2FA. 

If someone get access to your physical device, it's a problem. 

You can write down your master password, store in a safe.. some place safe in your house. 

*Email*
* Gmail has a confidential mode. Recipients can't copy, forward, print the email... but you can always screenshot or take a picture.
* Incognito mode
	* won't save browsing history, cookies, form data
	* but website will know your info, your work, school, and ISP know what you visited
	* You should use this on any friend's computer or public computer

*Encryption*
* Encryption is the scrambling of information so that it can’t be read without a key to decrypt it.
* https:// is a secure, encrypted way for browsers to communicate with web pages, without anyone in between able to read the contents.
* *End-to-end encryption* means that our messages are encrypted between us and who we are talking to, so even if we are using a third-party chat or video service, the companies in between are not able to decrypt, or read the contents of our communications.
* Zoom, for example, had previously advertised end-to-end encryption, but only implemented it as encryption between us and Zoom. Only recently have they rolled out true end-to-end encryption between the participants in a meeting, but some features won’t work as a result, like cloud recording and phone call-in.

To summarize, here are a few suggestions we have, to be more secure:
1. Use a password manager
2. Use two-factor authentication
3. Use (end-to-end) encryption
